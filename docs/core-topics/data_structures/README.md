## Core Data Structures

Dive in to explore these must-know data structures:

### Arrays

Fast, ordered collections with direct access by index. Perfect for fixed-size data or when order matters. [Learn more](./arrays/Arrays.md)

### Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

Flexible and resizable – Python’s lists let you add and adjust on the go. Great for dynamic collections. [Learn more](./lists/Lists.md)

### Graphs (Trees)

Hierarchical structures with a root and branches. Think sorted data and efficient lookups. [Learn more](./graph/Graphs.md)

### Dictionaries (Hash Tables)

Key-value pairs for lightning-fast lookups. Your go-to for storing unique identifiers! [Learn more](./dictionaries/Dictionaries.md)

### Graphs

Nodes connected by edges, ideal for networks, maps, and anything with relationships. [Learn more](./graphs/Graphs.md)

### Choosing the Right Data Structure 🌟

- **Arrays/Lists**: When you need quick access by index or work with ordered data.
- **Trees**: For hierarchical data, efficient searching, and sorting.
- **Dictionaries**: When you need speedy access via unique keys.
- **Graphs**: To represent and explore relationships, like networks.

### Assessment Tips 📝

- **Big O** is your best friend – focus on complexities!
- Get cozy with Python’s built-in `list`, `dict`, `set`, and know when to use each.
- Practice traversals (DFS, BFS) for trees and graphs – they’ll come in handy!

Happy coding! 💡
