### Arrays

Quick, ordered collections with direct access by index—great for fixed-size data or when order matters. [Learn more](./arrays/Arrays.md)

### Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

Flexible and resizable, Python’s lists let you add and adjust on the go—perfect for growing collections. [Learn more](./lists/Lists.md)

### Linked Lists

A flexible, sequential structure where each element points to the next, like stations on a train route. Great for dynamic additions and deletions when index access isn't crucial. [Learn more](./linked_lists/LinkedList.md)

### Graphs

Graphs map connections and relationships. They link **nodes** (like destinations) through **edges** (paths), making them ideal for networks or mapping routes. [Learn more](./graph/Graphs.md)

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical structures with roots and branches, great for sorted data and efficient lookups. Perfect for structures that don’t loop back, like family trees or file directories. [Learn more](./trees/Trees.md)

### Dictionaries (Hash Tables)

Key-value pairs for lightning-fast lookups. Ideal for storing unique identifiers! [Learn more](./dictionaries/Dictionaries.md)

### Stack

A stack is a “Last In, First Out” (LIFO) structure where the last item added is the first to be removed. Perfect for scenarios like undo operations or managing function calls. [Learn more](./stack/Stack.md)

### Queue

A queue is a **"First In, First Out" (FIFO)** structure where the first item added is the first one to be removed. Useful in situations where tasks need to be handled in the order they arrive, like processing print jobs or managing customer service requests. [Learn more](./queue/Queue.md)

### Choosing the Right Data Structure 🌟

- **Arrays/Lists**: For fast index access and when order matters—like a neatly ordered shelf.
- **Linked Lists**: For dynamic additions and deletions without shifting elements—perfect for when you need flexibility without strict index access.
- **Trees**: For hierarchy and efficient searching and sorting—think of them as natural organizers.
- **Dictionaries**: The go-to for fast lookups by unique keys—perfect for mapping one-to-one data.
- **Graphs**: For complex relationships, like social networks or transportation maps.

### Assessment Tips 📝

- **Big O Notation** is your best friend—get familiar with the complexities!
- Know when to use Python’s built-in `list`, `dict`, `set`, and `tuple` structures.
- Brush up on traversals (DFS, BFS) for trees and graphs—they’ll be handy!

Happy coding! 💡
