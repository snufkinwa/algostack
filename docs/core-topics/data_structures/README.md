### Arrays

Quick, ordered collections with direct access by index—great for fixed-size data or when order matters. [Learn more](./arrays/Arrays.md)

### Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

Flexible and resizable, Python’s lists let you add and adjust on the go—perfect for growing collections. [Learn more](./lists/Lists.md)

### Linked Lists

A flexible, sequential structure where each element points to the next, like stations on a train route. Great for dynamic additions and deletions when index access isn't crucial. [Learn more](./linked_lists/LinkedList.md)

### Graphs

Graphs map connections and relationships. They link **nodes** (like destinations) through **edges** (paths), making them ideal for networks or mapping routes. [Learn more](./graph/Graphs.md)

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical structures with roots and branches, great for sorted data and efficient lookups. Perfect for structures that don’t loop back, like family trees or file directories. [Learn more](./trees/Trees.md)

### Dictionaries (Hash Tables)

Key-value pairs for lightning-fast lookups. Ideal for storing unique identifiers! [Learn more](./dictionaries/Dictionaries.md)

### Choosing the Right Data Structure 🌟

- **Arrays/Lists**: For fast index access and when order matters—like a neatly ordered shelf.
- **Linked Lists**: For dynamic additions and deletions without shifting elements—perfect for when you need flexibility without strict index access.
- **Trees**: For hierarchy and efficient searching and sorting—think of them as natural organizers.
- **Dictionaries**: The go-to for fast lookups by unique keys—perfect for mapping one-to-one data.
- **Graphs**: For complex relationships, like social networks or transportation maps.

### Assessment Tips 📝

- **Big O Notation** is your best friend—get familiar with the complexities!
- Know when to use Python’s built-in `list`, `dict`, `set`, and `tuple` structures.
- Brush up on traversals (DFS, BFS) for trees and graphs—they’ll be handy!

Happy coding! 💡
