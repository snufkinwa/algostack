# AlgoStack üß±

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms resource hub - **AlgoStack**! This repository is all about data structures, algorithms, databases, and REST APIs with a focus on hands-on practice and problem-solving. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for interviews, technical assessments, or just brushing up on your skills, you‚Äôll find a structured path by topic and difficulty level.

## What‚Äôs Inside

This repository is organized into a few main sections to make it easy to navigate:

### 1. Core Topics

Each core topic has its own folder with explanations, code samples, and practical examples to help you master the fundamentals.

- **Algothinking**: This section focuses on the basics of algorithmic thinking, like **Big O notation** and **logarithmic concepts**. Understanding these ideas is key for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, which is especially useful during assessments or interviews.

- **Data Structures**: Covers essential data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, Stacks, and Queues. Each topic includes breakdowns and sample code for common operations and optimizations.

- **Algorithms**: This folder dives into Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Recursion, and other fundamental algorithms. It‚Äôs packed with annotated code to help you understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each approach.

- **Database**: Here, you‚Äôll find the basics of SQL, along with advanced queries, indexing, and tips for optimizing database performance.

- **REST APIs**: Covers the essentials of REST APIs, including HTTP methods, CRUD operations, and example endpoints, with pratical, basic examples.

### 2. Problem Sets by Difficulty

For each main topic (Data Structures, Algorithms, Database, REST APIs), there are three levels of problem sets to practice with:

- **Easy**: Basic problems to build confidence.
- **Medium**: Intermediate problems that reflect common interview scenarios.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems to push your skills and understanding.

Each problem includes:

- A quick summary to set the stage.
- Solution code.
- Detailed comments and explanations to walk you through the approach.

## Learning Resources

I‚Äôm using **InterviewCake** and **Zenva** as my main learning resources. They‚Äôre fantastic for breaking down complex topics into digestible lessons and actionable examples.

For practice and timed challenges, I turn to **HackerRank** and **LeetCode** towards the end of my prep to test my skills through hands-on problem-solving.

Happy coding, and good luck with your learning journey!
